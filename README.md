- Edit the `change_url` and `config` scripts too, or remove them if you have no use of them
- Add a `LICENSE` file for the package.
  - NB: this `LICENSE` file is not meant to necessarily be the same LICENSE as the upstream app - it is only the LICENSE you want this package's code to published with and you can choose it freely! (If you don't know which to choose, we recommend [the AGPL-3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.txt))
